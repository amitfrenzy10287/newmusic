# Web Developer test
This exercise is meant to test your general knowdlege and to show that you have well balanced skills in front end development.
Your assignment will be evaluated on the quality of your code, the ease of launching your project, the stability.
Candidates usually manage to do the assignment in 6 hours, but feel free to take the necessary time.

Good luck! :)

# Front-end (Our preference is ReactJS)
For the front end part, you will build a web page that will display a list of songs and their ratings taken from the attached JSON file.

- Songs should be listed in a responsive grid. Think mobile!
- Keep in mind that you can have more songs than the sample we gave. Think performance!
- Make the ratings editable by making the stars clickable.
- Each line should look like the attached screenshot (not pixel perfect). Mandatory elements are the Yousician logo, level, title, rating and artist. For other info, or color choice, you have complete freedom.
- Add filtering by level
- Add song search

Bonus:
- Add pagination, or infinite scroll
- Add some tests
- A good look on the frontend will be appreciated
